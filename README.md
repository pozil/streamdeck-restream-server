This solution requires three components to run:
1. A Node.js server (this project)
1. [A Chrome extension](https://github.com/pozil/restream-chrome-extension)
1. [A Stream Deck plugin](https://github.com/pozil/streamdeck-restream-plugin)

## Node.js Server Setup

1. Download or clone the [Node.js server repository](https://github.com/pozil/streamdeck-restream-server).

1. Ensure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) v22 or above by running this command in a terminal:
    ```sh
    node -v
    ```

1. Install the server dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

1. Start the server:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

## Chrome Extension Setup

Install the [Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/u/1/detail/restream-studio-controls/aljahkhjciggopmeccklmohhagoinpal?hl=en) from the Chrome Web Store.


## Stream Deck Plugin Setup

Download and install the [Stream Deck plugin](https://github.com/pozil/streamdeck-restream-plugin/releases/latest/download/org.pozil.restream.streamDeckPlugin).


## Configure Your Stream

1. Open Restream Studio
1. Ensure that the Node.js server is up and running. If not, open a terminal in the `streamdeck-restream-server` folder and restart the server by running `npm start`. Leave the terminal open.
1. Ensure that the Chrome extension icon is green. If not, check the [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section.
1. Create a Stream Deck profile and add actions from the Restream plugin. I recommend that you try the Toggle Camera action for a start.
1. Test the actions by pressing the related Stream Deck button. If a ⚠️ warning symbol appears, check the [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section.


## Troubleshooting

**Chrome extension icon is gray with a red stroke**

This either means that the Node.js server is not running or that the server cannot reach the Stream Deck plugin. Hover your mouse over the Chrome extension icon for more details about the issue.

**Stream Deck button shows a ⚠️ warning symbol**

This either means that the Node.js server is not running or that the server cannot reach the Chrome extension.
